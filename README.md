# Analyze Gender Diversity and Bias in Job Desciptions

The content, tone, and format of job bulletins can influence the quality of the applicant pool. Overly-specific job requirements may discourage diversity. 
The Los Angeles Mayorâ€™s Office has provided data for a Kaggle Competition to identify improvements needed in hiring process.

The goal is to analyze job postings to: 
- identify gendered language that can negatively bias the pool of applicants
- analyze the gender diversity and quality of the applicant pool
