# Analyze Gender Diversity and Bias in Job Desciptions

## Abstract
The content, tone, and format of job bulletins can influence the quality of the applicant pool. Overly-specific job requirements may discourage diversity. 
The Los Angeles Mayor’s Office has provided data for a Kaggle Competition to identify improvements needed in hiring process.

According to research, use of gendered language can deter certain applicants from applying to job postings. A few years ago, social scientists at the University of Waterloo and Duke University coded a long list of adjectives and verbs as masculine or feminine then scanned a popular job site to look for those words. They found (pdf) that job ads in male-dominated fields (like software programming) tended to use masculine-coded words such as “competitive” and “dominate” much more than job ads in female-dominated fields. Follow-up research confirmed such words made those job listings less appealing to women.

The goal is to analyze job postings to: 
  1. Identify gendered language that can negatively bias the pool of applicants
  2. Analyze the gender diversity and quality of the applicant pool
