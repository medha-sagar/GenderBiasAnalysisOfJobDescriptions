## Final Project : Analyze Diversity and Bias in Job Desciptions
### Introduction

The content, tone, and format of job bulletins can influence the quality of the applicant pool. Overly-specific job requirements may discourage diversity. 
The Los Angeles Mayorâ€™s Office has provided data for a Kaggle Competition to identify improvements needed in hiring process.

The goal is to analyze job postings to: 
- (1) identify language that can negatively bias the pool of applicants
- (2) analyze the diversity and quality of the applicant pool
