    "Use of gendered language can deter certain applicants from applying to job postings. A few years ago, social scientists at the University of Waterloo and Duke University coded a long list of adjectives and verbs as masculine or feminine then scanned a popular job site to look for those words. They found (pdf) that job ads in male-dominated fields (like software programming) tended to use masculine-coded words such as “competitive” and “dominate” much more than job ads in female-dominated fields. Follow-up research confirmed such words made those job listings less appealing to women."

    "Hiring content sometimes contains inadvertant use of harmful language. One example is using the term **minorities** to refer to **non-white** racial and ethnic groups collectively. This term can be degrading because it is typically associated with deficiency and inferiority. Instead of using minorities, which is also simply inaccurate in many contexts, consider using **people of color** or **underrepresented** groups."
